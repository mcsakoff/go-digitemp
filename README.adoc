This is a Go port of link:https://github.com/mcsakoff/pydigitemp[pyDigiTemp].

[WARNING]
The very beta version.

Originally written in Python to replace link:https://www.digitemp.com/[digitemp] utility in my pet project
and get direct access to 1-wire devices. It was created for reading DS1820 temperature sensor connected
to RS232 serial port through DS9097 adapter.

== Supported Hardware

=== Bus Driver

* link:http://www.maximintegrated.com/en/products/comms/ibutton/DS9097.html[DS9097] - COM port adapter which performs RS-232C level conversion.
* Custom 1-wire serial port interface (see below).

=== 1-Wire Devices Supported

== Usage

[TIP]
See detailed examples in _examples_ directory.

.Find ROM codes for all connected devices:
[source,go]
----
uart, _ := NewUartAdapter("/dev/cu.usbserial-1410")
roms, _ := NewAddressableDevice(uart).GetConnectedROMs()
for n, rom := range roms {
    log.Printf("%d: %s\n", n, rom)
}
----

.Get temperature from single sensor:
[source,go]
----
uart, _ := NewUartAdapter("/dev/cu.usbserial-1410")
sensor, _ := NewTemperatureSensor(uart, nil, true)
temp, _ := sensor.GetTemperatureFloat()
log.Printf("%.02f\n", temp)
----

=== 1-wire serial port interface

See link:http://martybugs.net/electronics/tempsensor/hardware.cgi[Serial Port Temperature Sensors - Hardware Interface]
for details.

=== USB/UART adapter

==== These are tested:

- link:docs/ds18b20-uart.svg[Simple connect in normal mode]
- link:docs/ds18b20-uart-par.svg[Simple connect in parasitic mode]
- link:docs/ds18b20-uart-dioda.svg[Using diode in normal mode]
- link:docs/ds18b20-uart-diodapar.svg[Using diode in parasitic mode]

Not all schematics work in all cases, depending on an adapter and cable length.

==== These are not tested yet:

- link:docs/ds18b20-uart-mosfet.svg[Using MOSFET transistors]
- link:docs/ds18b20-uart-npn.svg[.Using NPN transistors]
